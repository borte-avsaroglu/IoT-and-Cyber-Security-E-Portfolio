# IOT & Cyber Security
>My purpose of creating this repository is to create an e-portfolio of the lab works I have been working on and what I have done from week to week for the *Iot and cyber security* course I have taken.
## Week 1-2
### Week 1:
This is an article I created by examining the article about digital enterprise written by *Wei et al and Spremic*. Besides;

- What is a **"fully digital enterprise"**?
- What are the *cyber-security challenges/concerns* with a fully digital enterprise?
- What are the cyber security challenges for a *bricks and mortar SME wanting to become* a digital enterprise?

By answering the questions and I expressed my thoughts about the ***"Energy Crisis"*** experienced around the world in 2022.
You can review the ***"week1"*** documentation to review all of my work.

### Week 2:
I worked on ***Scanning Activities*** and I learned what these commands are and how they work;
- tracet
- ing
- nslookup
- whois
- ipconfig
- nmap

 I learned that we need to install some packages in order to run some of these commands in *windows command prompt*, and I also experienced running them in the *terminal in the linux operating system.* At the end of this chapter, I stated the difficulties I had, how I overcame them, and my *final report on the scanning activity.*
You can review the ***"week2"*** documentation to review all of my work.

### End of Unit Activities:
Since we completed week 1 and week 2, I did the end of chapter activities in this part. The abstracts are here. If you want to examine it in more detail, you can reach the full version of all activities from the ***"End-of-Unit-Activities"*** documentation located under the ***Week 1-2*** file.

#### Activity 1:

**Question:** 

Cloud platforms are becoming a very common commodity in the digital system. What are the benefits and draw backs in Cloud solutions with respect to cyber security? Present an argument with minimum 500 words in favour of or against cloud storage. What are the security risks involved in cloud vs local store . You should post your solution in the discussion group and provide at least two references.

**Answer:**

Cloud storage refers to the practice of storing data on a remote server accessed via the internet, rather than on a local server or personal device. It offers numerous benefits, including cost savings, flexibility, scalability, and increased collaboration. However, there are also potential security risks to consider when using cloud storage, such as the possibility of data breaches, loss of control over data, and vendor lock-in. It is important for organizations to carefully consider these risks and choose a reputable and secure provider...

#### Activity 2:

**Question:** 

In 2017 a ransomware termed as WannaCry unleased its malicious attack on a global scale. What cautions and safeguards should have been in place that could have averted this attack?

**Answer:**

- Install all available software updates as soon as they are released
- Use a third-party patch management tool
- Uninstall or disable unnecessary or unused software
- Isolate the system from the rest of the network
- Use a VPN when connecting to the internet
- Consider switching to a supported operating system
- Use security software specifically designed to protect against legacy software vulnerabilities..

#### Activity 3:

**Question:** 

Why is it important to have a backup system in place that works closely with cyber security framework? How are these two components are related? Please use your own personal computer as hypothetical machine and list the steps that you will adopt to backup your data.

**Answer:**

A backup system is a way to protect data against loss due to various causes, including cyber attacks. It is closely related to cyber security in that both are focused on protecting data and ensuring its availability. To create a backup system for a personal computer, one can choose a backup method (such as an external hard drive or cloud-based service), set it up, test it, schedule regular backups, and keep it up to date by periodically reviewing the data being backed up...

## Week 3-4

I did research on Cyber Kill Chain in Week 3-4. I researched the 7 steps of this model and wrote a report containing them. Besides these, I wrote a report on the article "A Worst Nightmare Cyberattack: The Untold Story Of The SolarWinds Hack". You can access these entire reports from the ***"Worst-Nightmare-CyberAttack"*** file and ***"CyberKillChain"*** file under the ***"Week3-4"*** file.

**What is The Cyber Kill Chain?**

The cyber kill chain is a model that describes the steps that an attacker goes through in a cyber attack, from initial reconnaissance to the achievement of their goals. It consists of seven stages: reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and actions on objectives. Understanding the cyber kill chain can help organizations develop strategies to detect and prevent attacks at various stages...

**A 'Worst Nightmare' Cyberattack:**

The SolarWinds hack was a true worst nightmare for many organizations and individuals. The fact that the attack went undetected for so long was particularly alarming, as it gave the hackers ample time to infiltrate the networks of some of the most well-protected organizations in the world and gather sensitive information. The impact of the hack was far-reaching and had serious national security implications, as it gave the hackers access to sensitive government systems and information...

## Week 4-5

In Week 4-5, I did research and applications about Kali Linux and wrote a report about it. Besides, I researched and wrote a report about Solar winds exploit using the Cyber Kill Chain. Although I will briefly talk about these in this section, you can find the full versions of the two reports under the ***"Week4-5"*** file, in the ***"Kali-Linux"*** and ***"Solar-Winds"*** Files.

**What is Kali Linux and Why people use Kali?**

Kali Linux is a security-focused operating system that comes pre-installed with a wide range of tools and utilities for digital forensics, penetration testing, and other security-related tasks. It is popular among cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts because of the comprehensive set of tools it provides, as well as its flexibility and customization options...

**Solar Winds exploit using the Cyber Kill Chain:**

Certainly! The SolarWinds exploit refers to a sophisticated cyberattack that was discovered in December 2020, in which hackers compromised the update process of SolarWinds' Orion software, a widely used IT management tool. The hackers then used the software to gain access to the networks of various government agencies and private companies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Energy...
