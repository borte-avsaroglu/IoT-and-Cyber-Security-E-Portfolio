# IOT & Cyber Security
>My purpose of creating this repository is to create an e-portfolio of the lab works I have been working on and what I have done from week to week for the *Iot and cyber security* course I have taken.
## Week 1-2
###Week 1:
This is an article I created by examining the article about digital enterprise written by *Wei et al and Spremic*. Besides;

- What is a **"fully digital enterprise"**?
- What are the *cyber-security challenges/concerns* with a fully digital enterprise?
- What are the cyber security challenges for a *bricks and mortar SME wanting to become* a digital enterprise?

By answering the questions and I expressed my thoughts about the ***"Energy Crisis"*** experienced around the world in 2022.
You can review the ***"week1"*** documentation to review all of my work.

### Week 2:
I worked on ***Scanning Activities*** and I learned what these commands are and how they work;
- tracet
- ing
- nslookup
- whois
- ipconfig
- nmap

 I learned that we need to install some packages in order to run some of these commands in *windows command prompt*, and I also experienced running them in the *terminal in the linux operating system.* At the end of this chapter, I stated the difficulties I had, how I overcame them, and my *final report on the scanning activity.*
